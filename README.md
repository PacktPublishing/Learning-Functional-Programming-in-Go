# Learning Functional Programming in Go
This is the code repository for [Learning Functional Programming in Go](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-functional-programming-go?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787281394), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book bridges the language gap for Golang developers by showing you how to create and consume functional constructs in Golang.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
func newSlice(s []string) *Collection {
    return &Collection{INVALID_INT_VAL, s}
}
```

If you want to run the Go projects discussed in each chapter, you need to install Go. If
you're on a Mac, visit here. Next, you need to get your Go development environment
running and start writing code.
Read the TL;DR subsection of the How to build and run Go projects section of the Appendix.
Go to Chapter 1, Pure Functional Programming in Go in the book and start reading
the Getting the source code section. Continue reading on how to set up and run your first
project.
